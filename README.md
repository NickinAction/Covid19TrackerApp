# Covid19TrackerApp
This is a COVID-19 Tracker app designed for IOS and Android phones using Xamarin.Forms for use in Canada.
## Overview
This app will update the user on important COVID-19 statistics such as new cases, deaths, and vaccinations in their local area and provincially/nationally in Canada. 
This is done by taking the location of the user and using GEOJson to locate them within a Canadian Public Health Unit. 
Once the user is located within a PHU, API requests are made to fetch local data pertaining to the aforementioned statistics.
National and Provincial data is also fetched. All of this information is then shown to the user.
